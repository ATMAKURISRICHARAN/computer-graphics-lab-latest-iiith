<p>
Rotation about an arbitrary axis is done in the following manner: <br/>
1. Rotate the arbitrary axis about one of the co-ordinate axes, say Y, to align it to one of the co-ordinate planes, say XY. <br/>
2. Rotate this axis about the Z axis to align it to the Y axis. <br/>
3. Perform the required rotation about the Y axis using R<sub>Y</sub>. <br/>
4. Reverse the steps 2 and 1 to put the axis back in its original alignment. <br/>
