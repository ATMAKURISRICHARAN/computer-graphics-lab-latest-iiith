<b>Hierarchical Transformations</b><br/>
<i>The Set-up: Articulated Arm</i>

<p>
This experiment shows the effect of transformations in a hierarchical model.
</p>
<p>
We constructed a hierarchical articulated arm model where each node/part follows a series of transformations from the root node to its current position. The top-most object in this hierarchy is the Shoulder followed by Elbow, Forearm, Wrist and Palm.
</p>
<p>
We applied a rotation transformation to the wrist where only the wrist and palm moves. 
This is followed by a rotation applied to elbow which moves the forearm, wrist and palm. 
And finally a rotation at the shoulder which is at the top-most level of the hierarchy moves all nodes/parts.

The transformations at each level of hierarchy can be edited by double clicking on the <code>Transformation</code> node of the corresponding level.
